# What is this?
Client website for a photographer/storyteller. She didn't end up going with this design, so there is still some placeholder text, but it looks great and I am proud of it.

# Some cool features
- minimalist design
- using a swipe feature to move through a low-text story
- optimized to give to people who need a quick idea of who you are
- simple sidebar menu
- fully responsive

# Photo credits
All the background photos used in this website (except the two background animations) were taken by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/roundourworld_/?hl=en">@roundourworld_</a>, so if you like them, hire her.
